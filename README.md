# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built **from scratch** using React.  
I was inspired by the design from [Venkateeshh’s Portfolio Website](https://github.com/Venkateeshh/Portfolio-Website.git), but **all code and implementations are my own**.

--->

## Technologies Used

- React  
- CSS (for styling)  
- React Router (for navigation)  
- JavaScript (for dynamic functionality)  

--->

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohdAli056/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website
npm install
```

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits, and you’ll see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section in CRA docs for more info.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.  
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes for the best performance.  
The build is minified and filenames include hashes.

### `npm run eject`

> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  

Use this only if you need full control over the build tools and configuration.  
It will copy all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
